5. a) The spectral density plot below shows spikes around 0 and about 0.33, which suggests the the process will show oscillatory behavior with a peiod of about 3.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}

library(astsa)

arma.spec(ar = c(0, 0, .99), log="no", main = "Spectral Density Plot")


```


b) The time series plot below indicate that after about every 3 points the series repeats after 3 points
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}

ts_AR <- arima.sim(n=100, list(ar=c(0, 0, .99)))

plot(ts_AR, type = "o", ylab = "simulated process", main = "Time Series Plot")
```
